Mollify S3 Plugin Version 1.0
==============================

1) Install Mollify as normally, but don't setup published folders

   If you are using existing Mollify installation, make sure all published folders are removed
   before continuing, otherwise errors will occur.

2) Register Amazon account at https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html

3) Setup configuration with Amazon keys with following formats:

	$PLUGINS = array(
		"S3" => array(
			"AWS_KEY" => "GET_AWS_KEY_FROM_AMAZON",
			"AWS_SECRET_KEY" => "GET_AWS_SECRET_KEY_FROM_AMAZON"
		)
	);
	
	These keys can be retrieved from Amazon account:
	- Go to http://aws.amazon.com/.
	- Click Account and then click Security Credentials.
	- Scroll down to Access Credentials and make sure the Access Keys tab is selected.
	  The AWS Access Key ID appears in the Access Key column. To view the Secret Access Key, click Show.
	  
	Optional settings (in the plugin settings array):
	- "REGION": Amazon region code, by default EU

4) Open Mollify admin util and setup published folders:
  - for published folder name, use any name you like
  - for published folder path, give plain text unique identifier, for example "images1", "images2" etc, but do not use path separators "/" or "\" etc


Notes
-----
- When S3 plugin is enabled, no other filesystems are supported (ie. cannot publish one folder from S3 and another from local drive). In future this will be possible.
- In beta version, installer instructions for publishing folders are not valid for S3
- Amazon S3 does not support copying, moving or renaming folders
