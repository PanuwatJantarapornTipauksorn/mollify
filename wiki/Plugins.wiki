#summary Mollify plugins

= Installing plugins =

Plugins are installed simply by downloading the plugin package and unzipping them into "backend/plugin" folder.

Plugins are registered with a variable PLUGINS in configuration.php:

{{{
$PLUGINS = array(
	[PLUGIN_NAME] => [SETTINGS],
	...
}}}

Plugin name is the same as the folder name in the installation package. Settings are plugin specific options, or empty array.

For example:

{{{
$PLUGINS = array(
	"MollifyPluginFoo" => array("foo_options" => "foo"),
	"MollifyPluginBar" => array()
}}}

Whenever plugins are installed or updated, open the Mollify updater util to check if database update is required.
