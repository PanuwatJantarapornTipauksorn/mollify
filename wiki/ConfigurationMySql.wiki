#summary Configuration for MySQL
#labels Phase-Deploy

= 1. Prerequisities =

1) First you have to create MySQL user and database for Mollify, and grant the new user for CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE rights in the created database.

2) Create configuration.php as in following example:

{{{
	<?php
		$CONFIGURATION_PROVIDER = 'mysql';
		$DB_HOST = "localhost";
		$DB_DATABASE = "mollify";
		$DB_USER = "mollify";
		$DB_PASSWORD = "mollify";

	?>
}}}

Values $DB_HOST and $DB_DATABASE are optional. If these are not defined, it is assumed that MySQL server is running on localhost, and database is called "mollify".

= 2. Installation with Installer =

Start installation by opening following page into your browser: "`http://[URL_TO_MOLLIFY_INSTALL_DIR]/install/`", where `[URL_TO_MOLLIFY_INSTALL_DIR]` is the mollify backend folder where, for example, configuration.php and service.php are located.

Installer will check configuration and system, and guide you through the installation.

= 3. Manual Installation =

Database tables can be created manually by running script "`/install/mysql/sql/create_tables_[VERSION].sql`". For required parameters, run "`/install/mysql/sql/params_[VERSION].sql`" as well.

To be able to log into Mollify, you must create first admin user manually with following SQL:

{{{
	INSERT INTO user (name, password, permission_mode) VALUES ('[USER_NAME]','[PASSWORD]','A')
}}}

where `[USER_NAME]` is freely selectable user name, and `[PASSWORD]` an MD5 hashed password.
