#summary Configuration in single user mode
#labels Phase-Deploy

= 1 Configuration =

	To set up a single-user environment, make sure variable $USERS in file "configuration.php" is empty or not defined.

	For example:

	{{{ $USERS = array();}}}

= 2 Published Directories =

	Mollify supports freely selectable published directories, which need not to have any relation with each other.

	Use following format to define published directories:

{{{
$PUBLISHED_DIRECTORIES = array(
	[DIR_ID] => array("name" => [DIR_NAME], "path" => [DIR_PATH]),
	...
);
}}}

Rules are:
  * Directory id's `[DIR_ID]` can be freely chosen, but they must be unique
  * Path `[DIR_PATH]` must be absolute path in local file system
  * Actual file system folder name is not shown to user, but instead the name `[DIR_NAME]` defined in the configuration


= 3 User Access Control ==

	Mollify supports configurable user access control for files. By default, when no configuration is done, users have read-only permissions to all files.

	File permissions can be granted in two levels:
	  * User default file permission
	  * File specific file permission

	Possible file permission values are:
	  * `RO` = Read-only (user can only download and view details)
	  * `RW` = Read and write (user can also rename and delete file)

== 3.1 User Default File Permission ==

	Default file permission applies to everybody, and it is defined with configuration variable `$FILE_PERMISSION_MODE`.

	For example:

{{{
    $FILE_PERMISSION_MODE = "RW";
}}}

	This will give all users read/write permissions, unless file specific permissions override this.

=== 3.2 File Specific Permissions ===

	Mollify supports file specific file permissions, which override any possible default permissions. File specific permissions are defined in folder level (no inheritance in folder hierarchy), with a user access control file (see [http://code.google.com/p/mollify/wiki/UserAccessControlFiles wiki page] for more information).

	Each folder has its own user access control file, which applies only to files in that folder.

	Each file can have permissions set to user id's:
	  * In single-user environment, only permissions given with id "`*`" are applied

	Example scenarios:
	  * Global default permission "RO", file has permission "`* = RW`": User will get read and write permissions
	  * Global default permission "RW", file has permission "`* = RO`": User will get read-only permissions
