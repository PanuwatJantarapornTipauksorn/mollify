#summary Customizing resources

= Introduction =

Mollify allows storing customized versions of resources outside Mollify folders, which makes updates easier.

= Client resources =

Using resource map feature ([ResourceMap]), different resources can be mapped into custom location. These include any client loaded resources:
  * plugin texts
  * plugin javascripts
  * plugin css
  * templates

Copy original file into the custom location, and add resource map entry to load your version instead.
 
For example, following loads custom "mainview.html" from folder "custom" :
{{{
	mollify.App.init({
		"resource-map" : {
			"templates/mainview.html" : "custom/mainview.html"
		},
		...
	});
}}}

For example, following loads custom localizations file for Registration plugin:
{{{
	mollify.App.init({
		"resource-map" : {
			"backend/plugin/Registration/admin/texts_en.js": "custom/texts_registration_en.js"
		},
		...
	});
}}}

= Backend texts =

When a backend feature needs text resources, these are stored in a text file.

Customizations location is defined in configuration.php with following setting:
{{{
	$CONFIGURATION = array(
		"customizations_folder" => "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/mollify/custom/backend/",
		...
	);
}}}

Now any text resources are first searched from this folder.

For example customizing LostPassword plugin texts:
  # Copy "backend/plugin/LostPassword/PluginLostPasswordMessages.txt" into customizations folder defined in configuration.php
  # Make your own modifications
