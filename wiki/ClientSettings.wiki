#summary All available client settings

Following settings are available in client (and their default values):

{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
	mollify.init({
		"service-path": "backend/",	// service path
		"expose-file-links": false,		// expose file links
		"show-login": true,			// show default login page
		"default-view-mode": "list",	// default view mode
		"icon-view-thumbnails": false,	// show icon thumbnails in icon view mode
		"list-view-columns": {
								// file list column setup
		},
		"plugins": [
								// client plugins
		]
	});
</script>
}}}

== Service path (`service-path`) ==

Location of the backend script relative to the host file. See [http://code.google.com/p/mollify/wiki/Installation#4.1._Relocating_host_page_or_backend_interface_files installation] for more info.

== Expose file links (`expose-file-links`) ==

Expose file links creates invisible file download links into the page, which makes it possible to use download managers (like [http://www.downthemall.net/ DownThemAll!] for Firefox) to download many files simultaneously as well as pause or resume downloads.

== Show default login page (`show-login`) ==

To use custom login page, the default login page can be disabled with this setting.
