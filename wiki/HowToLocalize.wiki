= How to upgrade old localizations into new version =

All the texts in previous (prior to 1.7.5) versions are identical to the new format, only the location and locale selection has changed.

Therefore old localizations can be used when updating the language files:

1) Create new localization file according to previous chapter

2) Find old versions from [http://code.google.com/p/mollify/source/browse/trunk/mollify/src/org/sjarvela/mollify/client/localization/]

3) Copy values from old file (NOTE! be careful as new file has a different format, each title must be followed by ":", value must be surrounded by parenthesis "" and lines must be ended with comma)
