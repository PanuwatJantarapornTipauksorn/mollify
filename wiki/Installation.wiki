#summary Installation instructions
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

= 1. Installation =

	 #  Unzip Mollify installation package (for example with command "`unzip mollify_[VER].zip`")
	 #  Copy extracted directory "mollify" into your web server root directory (or any other place of your choice)
	 #  Open installer at address "http://your.host.name/mollify/backend/install/". Installer will guide you through the configuration, for more information see chapter 3.
	 #  Log in as admin and choose "Configuration" in app header to configure users and published folders

= 2. Upgrading =

	Upgrading Mollify requires following steps:

	 #  Log into Mollify as admin user, and leave the session open for the upgrade process
	 #  For backup, move or rename old installation directory "mollify" into different name or location
	 #  Copy directory "mollify" from the latest Mollify installation package
	 #  From backup, restore "configuration.php" into the new installation directory (as well as other customized files, such as "index.html")
	 #  Remove backup directory
	 #  Open update utility at address "http://your.host.name/mollify/backend/update/" to check if further update actions are required.

= 3. Configuration =
	
	Mollify requires database, and supports MySQL and SQLite databases.
	
	Start configuration by creating "configuration.php" under directory "mollify/backend", examples can be found in folder "example" in installation package.

	Follow instructions based on configuration type:
	 * [ConfigurationMySql MySQL Database]
	 * [ConfigurationSQLite SQLite Database]
	 
	For additional options, see additional settings on [ClientSettings client] and [BackendSettings backend].


= 4. Modifying Installation =

	Host page can be located anywhere, the only thing that matters is that backend interface files (`*`.php) are located under the same directory or in its subdirectories.

	If you wish to locate backend interface files (`*`.php) into a different location, you must define this location in the index html file, with following format:

{{{
	<html>
		<head>
			...
			<script type="text/javascript">
				$(document).ready(function() {
					mollify.App.init({
						"service-path": "[RELATIVE_PATH]",
						...
					});
			</script>
		</head>
		...
	</html>
}}}

	Replace `[RELATIVE_PATH]` with path to the backend interface files, relative to the index html file.
