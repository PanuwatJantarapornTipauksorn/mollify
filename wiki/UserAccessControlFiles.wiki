#summary Format of the user access control files

= Introduction =

This page describes how to write user access control files.


= Details =

Each folder in the published file system can have a user access control file. This file contains file specific permissions, which applies only for files in the same physical folder.

Rules are:
  * File name must be "*mollify.uac*" This file is not visible to clients.
  * File content must be plain text.
  * Each row defines permissions for one file
  * Row format is "`<FILE NAME>[TAB]([TAB]...)<FILE PERMISSIONS>`" (ie. file name and permissions are separated with one or more tab characters)
  * Format for file permissions (`<FILE PERMISSIONS>`) is "`<USER ID>=<FILE PERMISSION>`"
  * Multiple user permissions are separated with a comma ","
  * User id "`*`" applies to all users, unless user specific permission is given.
  * Possible permissions are:
    * "RW" = read and write
    * "RO" = read-only

For example (ignore syntax coloring):

{{{
Example Datasheet.xls		*=rw, U1=ro
ReadMe.txt			*=ro, U2=rw
Picture.png			U1=rw
}}}

This configuration gives:
  * User with id "`U1`" read-only permission to "`Example Datasheet.xls`", and read and write permission for all other users
  * User with id "`U2`" read and write permission to "`ReadMe.txt`", and read-only permissions for all other users
  * User with id "`U1`" read and write permission to "`Picture.png`", for other users this file does not change permissions (default permission are applied)
  * For all other files in the folder, user default permissions apply
