#summary Configuration for SQLite

= 1. Preparations =

Before installing Mollify, create configuration.php as in following example:

{{{
	<?php
		$CONFIGURATION_TYPE = 'sqlite';
		$DB_FILE = 'db.file';
	?>
}}}

Value $DB_FILE defines the location of the SQLite database file. Using absolute path is recommended.

= 2. Installation =

After creating configuration, open the installer "`http://[URL_TO_MOLLIFY_BACKEND_DIR]/install/`", where `[URL_TO_MOLLIFY_BACKEND_DIR]` is the mollify backend folder where, for example, configuration.php and r.php are located.

Installer will check your configuration and system, and guide you through the installation.
