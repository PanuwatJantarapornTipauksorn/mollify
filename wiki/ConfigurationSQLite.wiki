#summary Configuration for SQLite

= 1. Preparations =

Before installing Mollify, create configuration.php as in following example:

{{{
	<?php
		$CONFIGURATION = array(
			"db" => array(
				"type" => "sqlite",
				"file" => "db.file",
			),
			...
		);
	?>
}}}

Value "file" defines the location of the SQLite database file. Using absolute path is recommended.

For SQLite version 3, use type value "sqlite3".

= 2. Installation =

After creating configuration, open the installer "`http://[URL_TO_MOLLIFY_BACKEND_DIR]/install/`", where `[URL_TO_MOLLIFY_BACKEND_DIR]` is the mollify backend folder where, for example, configuration.php and r.php are located.

Installer will check your configuration and system, and guide you through the installation.
