= Languages =

By default, Mollify opens in english. To change default language, use following client option:
{{{
	$(document).ready(function(){	
		mollify.App.init({
			"language": {
				default: "de"
			},
			...
		});
	});
}}}

== User language ==

By default all users use the default language. To enable user specific language, list all available options 
{{{
	$(document).ready(function(){	
		mollify.App.init({
			"language": {
				default: "de",
				options: ["en", "de"]
			},
			...
		});
	});
}}}

Now user admin will allow choosing from these language options.

= How to correct localization errors =
