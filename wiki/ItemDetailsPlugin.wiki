#summary Item details plugin

= Introduction =

Item details plugin is built-in plugin that provides details section in the file or folder popup.

= Configuration =

Register plugin by adding following into configuration.php (or merge into existing plugins array):

{{{
	$PLUGINS = array(
		"ItemDetails" => array()
	);
}}}

And following into client settings:

{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
	mollify.init({
		"service-path": "backend/",
		"plugins": [
			new ItemDetailsPlugin({
				...
			})
		]
	});
}}}

For configuration, see below.

= Item details configuration =

Details shown for files or folders can be configured by the type, with following format:

{{{
	new ItemDetailsPlugin({
		[TYPE] : {
			[DATA_KEY] : [CONFIGURATION],
			...
		},
		...
	})
}}}

The type can be:
 * file extension, like "`png`" or "`pdf`"
 * "`[folder]`" for folders
 * "`[file]`" for files
 * "`*`" for default configuration

Data key is the id of the data displayed. Mollify provides following built-in data keys:
 * "`last-modified`" : Time of the last modification
 * "`size`" : Size of the file
 * "`exif`" : Image exif data (see example below on how to register exif renderer)

Some plugins may provide more data keys.

Configuration can override following:
 * "`title`" : Localization key of the title text

For example:
{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
	mollify.init({
		"service-path": "backend/",
		"plugins": [
			new ItemDetailsPlugin({
				"pdf": {
					"size" : {}
				},
				"jpg,tiff": {
					"last-modified" : {},
					"size": {},
					"exif": {},
				},
				"*": {
					"last-modified" : {},
					"size": {}
				}
			}, [new ExifDetails()])
		]
	});
}}}

This configuration will show last modification stamp and size for all files, except for pdf files only size. Image files (jpf and tiff) will also display EXIF data, which requires ExifDetails registered with the configuration.
