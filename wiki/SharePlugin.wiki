#summary Share plugin

= Introduction =

Share plugin is built-in plugin that provides possibility to share any file or folder.

= Configuration =

Share plugin has following settings:
  * uploader

Uploader setting is optional. If this setting is defined, all events with matching id will be logged (wildcard match is done automatically). To log all events, leave this setting out.

Configure plugin by adding following into configuration.php (or merge into existing plugins array):

{{{
	$PLUGINS = array(
		"Share" => array(
			"uploader" => "PATH_TO_PUBLIC_UPLOADER"
		)
	);
}}}

And following into client settings:

{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
	mollify.init({
		"service-path": "backend/",
		"plugins": [
			new SharePlugin()
		]
	});
}}}

*NOTE* After configuration is done, share plugin requires installation via Mollify update util.

= Usage =

When share plugin has been registered in both, client and server, there will be a new option in file/folder popup "Share". This will open a list for all shares made for the file or folder, where you can also get the link for the share.

= Uploader setting =

By default, folder link will open basic HTML file uploader. With setting "uploader" the uploader can be changed.

Plupload plugin (since version 1.0.6) supports public uploader. Configure it with following setting:

{{{
	$PLUGINS = array(
		"Share" => array(
			"uploader" => "plugin/Plupload/public"
		)
	);
}}}
