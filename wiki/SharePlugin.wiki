		"Share" => array(
			"uploader" => "PATH_TO_PUBLIC_UPLOADER"
		)
	);
}}}

{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
	mollify.init({
		"service-path": "backend/",
		"plugins": [
			new SharePlugin()
		]
	});
}}}

*NOTE* After configuration is done, share plugin requires installation via Mollify update util.
