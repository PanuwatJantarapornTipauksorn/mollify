== 1. Client error "Failed to get response from server" ==

	When this error occurs on the client, it is due to either of two things:

	a) *Client cannot connect to the server*

	b) *Client can connect to server, but server never responds*

	
	In both cases, it is always best to first check PHP error log, usually the reason can be found there.

	If there are no PHP error log entries, it is case of client cannot connect to server (ie. it tries to access backend interface files in a wrong place). If possible, you should check your web server access logs to see what resource it tries to access. Also check your backend interface file locations (see [http://code.google.com/p/mollify/wiki/Installation Installation wiki]), that it is set up properly.

	In such error cases, it may be useful to see client logs, see [http://code.google.com/p/mollify/wiki/ConfigurationAdditionalOptions configuration wiki] (chapter 4, Client Logging) for more information [http://getfirebug.com/ Firebug] plugin for Firefox browser is also very good tool for investigating what resources a page tries to access.

	If, on the other hand, PHP log reveals errors, it is a case of invalid system setup or configuration.

	Common PHP errors and their reasons are:
  * `Call to undefined function:  json_encode()`: PHP version is lower than 5.2, and is not supported

== 2. Nothing happens on zip download, or downloaded zip is unreadable ==

	When a file or a folder is downloaded as zip package and nothing happens or downloaded zip cannot be read, zip package processing fails. Check your PHP error log, and see [http://code.google.com/p/mollify/wiki/Installation Installation wiki] for more information about zip options.
