== 1. Failed to get response from server ==

When this error occurs on the client, it is due to either of two things:

  # Client cannot connect to the server
  # Client can connect to server, but it never responds

In both cases, it is always best to first check php error log, usually the reason can be found there.

  * If there is no entries, it is case of client cannot connect to server. If possible, you can check your web server access logs to see what resource it tries to access. Also check your backend interface file locations (see Installation wiki). FireBug plugin for Firefox browser is also very good tool for investigating what resources it tries to access.
  * If php error log reveals errors, those must be resolved.
