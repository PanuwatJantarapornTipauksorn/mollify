	In case of errors, do following steps before reporting new issue:

  # Enable server side logging by adding following setting in configuration.php:
{{{
	$SETTINGS = array(
		...
		"debug" => TRUE
	);
}}}
  # Enable client side logging by adding following parameter in URL: "log_level=DEBUG". For example, "`http://YOUR_HOST/mollify/?log_level=DEBUG`"
  # Recreate the error, and copy all the logging information into the issue report. If you have access to PHP error logs, include it as well.

	If you don't want to post logs here in public, you can send them to me directly with the issue link.
