#summary File uploader

Mollify has HTML5 uploader (based on BlueImp [https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload JQuery-File-Upload]).

Uploader settings are defined in Mollify app init:

{{{
mollify.App.init({
	… ,
	"html5-uploader": {
		...
	}
}, [ … ]);
}}}

JQuery-File-Upload options are available at [https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options]

== Chunked upload ==

To avoid server upload size restrictions, add following client setting that enables chunked upload:
{{{
...,
"html5-uploader": {
	maxChunkSize: 100000
}
}}}

Use chunk size as big as possible (but smaller than the server max upload size).
